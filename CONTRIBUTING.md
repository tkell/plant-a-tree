How to contribute
-----------------

The preferred way to contribute to plant-a-tree is to fork the
[main repository](https://github.com/tkell/plant-a-tree) on GitHub.

Commit your changes to a branch, and then push them to Github. Then, go to the web page of your fork, and click 'Pull request' to send your changes to the maintainers for review.

(If any of the above sounds like magic, take a look at the
[Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web, or the guide to [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/))
