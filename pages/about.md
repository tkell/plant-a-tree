Celebrate With Trees is a site about planting trees! Why plant trees?

Trees are the lungs of Planet Earth.  Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the air.  We all know that the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is heating up our Earth, changing the climate, and making our planet less and less able to sustain human life and other creatures.

Scientists estimate that [a trillion trees need to be planted to remove the excess carbon accumulated in our atmosphere](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/04/planting-billions-trees-best-tackle-climate-crisis-scientists-canopy-emissions){:target="_blank"}. By planting trees, each of us is contributing towards reaching that challenging total.


We believe in:
* Planting trees locally, [to improve and connect with our local surroundings](https://www.treepeople.org/tree-benefits){:target="_blank"}.
* Planting indigenous trees and plants, [so they'll thrive where they are planted](https://thetyee.ca/News/2020/02/28/If-We-Plant-Trees-They-Must-Be-Native-Trees/){:target="_blank"}.
* Planting fruit and nuts trees, to grow (delicious!) food close to home.
* Planting trees ourselves, to get our hands dirty, [have fun, and be healthy](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/antidepressant-microbes-soil.htm){:target="_blank"}.

Julia just read a fabulous book entitled _To Speak for the Trees – My Life’s Journey from Ancient Celtic Wisdom to a Healing Vision of the Forest_ by Diana Beresford-Kroeger (Random House Canada, Toronto, 2019).  The author explains that the Earth was once covered in forests that provided food, medicine, and building materials to indigenous peoples, as well as maintaining the balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere.  She writes, “In these pages, I have laid out a plan for every one of us to fight for and save the global forest, our planet and ourselves.  And it's not a complicated plan.  It’s as simple as protecting what we still have and planting one native tree each per year for six years.  We can achieve that goal and we have to do so – not just for ourselves, but for all the children who will follow us, the future generations on whose behalf I’ve worked all my life.”

**Where will you plant your tree this year?**

We also think that getting other people planting trees in other parts of the world is great.  Here are some links about that:
