Trees need to be planted carefully and kept watered until they are well established.

First, ask the organization that is providing your planting site, which types of trees they think would be best on the land.  Different trees thrive with different amounts of water and sunshine, and like different kinds of soil.  For example, alders and cedars like fairly wet conditions, while Douglas firs need well-drained deep soils.

Next, shop at your local native plant nurseries for the recommended trees.  Ask the nursery staff what season of the year is best for planting the trees.  Often trees are best planted in the fall, so they can get well rooted before the heat of summer arrives.  Also, ask how to plant and care for the trees.  Do they need mycorrhizae (fungal spores) to help them get well rooted?  Would some kind of organic fertilizer help?  How much water is needed at planting time?

Once the trees are planted, make sure volunteers commit to dropping by regularly to water the trees.  Depending on how much rain your locale receives, you may need to water for a year or more.
