# Celebrate With Trees

Plant a tree!

## TODO
- make smaller pictures, so things load faster
- do some basic SEO??!?
- update "post" dates to make them a bit real


- Other changes
On the home page there are some inconsistencies compared to what we have on other pages.

Please change "We believe in planting indigenous trees, locally â€“ and have assembled a collection of resources to help you do this!" to 
"We believe in planting local indigenous trees to restore ecosystems, or fruit and nut trees to improve local food security.  We've assembled a collection of resources to help you do this!"
## too wordy


- About Page
I'm not sure we've explained clearly how this site came to be.  How about adding at the top of the About page;
How this Website Came to Be
The positive and generous responses of guests at Julia's 70th birthday party and at Ian and Julia's wedding was so heartening that we felt others could use the idea of planting trees instead of receiving birthday or wedding gifts.  So Julia's son, Thor, built us this website to spread the idea of trees as gifts - gifts for the people who are celebrating and gifts for the future of humans on Earth.
## no need, we've got this elsewhere

- Please remove "(Add supporting links here.)", because we've got links on each line.
## are we happy with two links?
